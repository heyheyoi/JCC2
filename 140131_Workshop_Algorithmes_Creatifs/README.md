##Algorithmes Cr√©atifs Workshop
*Stereolux, Nantes - January 2014*

**Natural-Artificial environments for interactions. Vector Fields and Graphs**

I'll upload soon some notes here that will make it easier to follow the ideas we worked on during this workshop, as the code is not exhaustively commented. Meanwhile, the pdf file contains the slides I used.

Two Processing libraries are used in the sketches:
- Traer physics: http://murderandcreate.com/physics/
- robotacid's ai.pathfinder: http://robotacid.com/PBeta/AILibrary/Pathfinder/
